Project Brief: Estate Management Application Development

Objective:

Develop a fully functional estate management application using Next.js and React within 4 weeks. The app should manage property listings with details like property title, description, category, type, location, price, and status. Additionally, the app should allow users to search for properties, filter by category or location, and include functionalities for favoriting properties and scheduling viewings.

Project Requirements:

Use Next.js for the front-end framework.
Create an array of objects for property data with the following properties:
title: The title of the property.
description: A brief description of the property.
category: The category of the property (e.g., Apartment, House, Office).
type: The type of property (e.g., Sale, Rent).
location: The location of the property.
price: The price of the property.
status: The status of the property (e.g., Available, Sold, Rented).
Implement search functionality for properties, categories, and locations.
Implement filters for categories and locations.
Include functionalities for favoriting properties and scheduling viewings.
Use Context API for state management.
