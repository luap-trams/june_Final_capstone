Estate Management Application

Project Brief

The Estate Management Application is being developed by Paul Akaninyene Smart, a consultant for SmartOptions Property Solutions. This project aims to create a fully functional estate management platform using Next.js and React. The application will manage property listings, including features such as search, filtering, favoriting, and scheduling viewings.
